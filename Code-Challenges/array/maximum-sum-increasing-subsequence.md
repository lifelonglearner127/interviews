Maximum Sum Increasing subsequence is a subsequence of a given list of integers, whose sum is maximum and in the subsequence, all elements are sorted in increasing order.
```
Input:
Sequence of integers. {3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1}
Output:
Increasing subsequence whose sum is maximum. {3, 4, 5}.

```python
def find_solution(l):
    for i in range(len(l)):
        for j in range(i)
